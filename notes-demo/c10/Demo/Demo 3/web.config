              The value presented is in kilobytes. 
              To allow files larger than the default of 4 MB, you need to change this property
              
              Remark: If you are working with smaller files, 
                      it is advisable to reduce the size allotted for the request to the Web
                      server by decreasing the value of the maxRequestLength property. 
                      This helps safeguard your application from a denial of service attack.
